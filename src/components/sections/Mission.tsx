            It started with a simple observation: too many great ideas die
            before they ever see the light of day—not because the idea was
            wrong, but because the path to execution was cluttered. Tools were
            fragmented, systems too complex, and founders were drowning in
            busywork before they could validate a single assumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've been in those shoes. We've built, launched, failed, and
            succeeded. And along the way, one truth became
            clear—entrepreneurship doesn't need to be this hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we set out to build something different. A frictionless
            foundation for anyone bold enough to take the leap. A place where
            you don't need to be a developer, marketer, or ops expert to get
            started. Just bring your idea—we'll take care of the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to make starting and scaling a business radically
            simpler. Not by adding more tools, but by designing better ones.
            Seamless, integrated, and founder-first.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're not just building software. We're building leverage for the
            next generation of creators.
